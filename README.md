The airline faced several operational difficulties, ranging from declining route performance to underutilized flight capacity. Despite growing passenger demand in some areas, inefficiencies were noted across several routes, with some underperforming. Additionally, seasonal fluctuations weren’t being fully leveraged, leading to mismatches between supply and demand.
These problems created a ripple effect:
 • Declining profitability on key routes.
 • Wasted resources due to low seat utilization.
 • Missed opportunities for expansion and market leadership.
 This led to the need for a comprehensive data analysis to pinpoint the root causes 
of these issues and drive actionable insights.

By analyzing flight data, several critical factors were uncovered that were affecting overall performance:
 1.Inconsistent Route Growth: 
• Certain routes were thriving while others showed a year-over-year decline in passenger numbers. This indicates that demand forecasting and route planning needed to be realigned. 
1.Low Seat Utilization:
 • Routes with less than 50% seat utilization were identified, indicating over-capacity on flights. This was a major contributor to operational inefficiencies. 
1.Seasonal Peaks in Demand: 
• Cities experienced predictable surges in passenger numbers during certain months, but the airline's scheduling wasn’t fully aligned with these peaks, leading to unbalanced resource allocation.
 1.Distance Efficiency: 
• Long-distance routes with higher passenger volume were not being optimized, and in some cases, underperforming short-distance routes were over-served.
